WHAT IS?

Highexplosive is not a clone of Ogame, Travian or similar browser games. Highexplosive is a role and strategy game, with game directors that could consent in the violation of the rules if the circumstance is appropiate.

Highexplosive is an asynchronous turn game. A player chooses between multiple options at the pace he wants and, after he is done, he presses the end turn button. Whenever all the princes of the different houses have pressed this end turn button, the turn ends and a new one starts. This will be explained in detail below.

Highexplosive is a social game, but not massive. This means that the number of players are very limited towards what the game directors consider. In a first place, I will recommend about 6 players per house for a total number o 36 people in a session. Of course, this number is flexible and later experiences could move it towards a bigger (or smaller) figure. 

In Highexplosive players took the role of one (and only one) noble of a powerful planet confederation called House. They can decide in the economy, the politics, espionage or warfare of their portion of universe. How powerful a player is, is determined by his level in the hierarchy of the House.  Varying from the control of the whole House (called, the prince), to the control of a single sector within the reign (a minor noble).  Of course, during the game, the position of the different nobles could be changed by external or internal happenings.
